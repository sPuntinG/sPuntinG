# 🌏 Hey everyone, Giulia here! 🌍

Quantitative biologist by training, I fell in love with (`R`) coding while working on my scientific research projects. 
Now I'm focusing on advancing my coding and analytical skills. 
Passionate about Data Analysis and Visualization. 
Excited about using data to tackle real-world challenges and drive positive change.

## My Skills 🛠️
My coding journey has been predominantly self-taught. I've developed my skills while working on real datasets and analytical problems as part of my academic research work.<br>
`#R` `#RTidyverse` `#ggplot` `#DataVisualization`
`#Communication` `#ScientifcWriting` 
`#Bioinformatics` `#Microbiome` `#MarineBiology`

## What I Do 🎯

1. **Data Visualization Portfolio** 📊  
Explore my collection of cool visualizations, including ggplot plots from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/sPuntinG/TidyTuesday) contributions. Stay tuned for the upcoming additions of R Shiny dashboards for dynamic data interactions!

2. **Workshops & Presentations** 🎓  
Have a look at the materials from my R workshops! I focusing on data management, data wrangling, and data exploration (EDA) with the beautiful R Tidyverse. I had a great time creating and presenting them, and I would love to further develop this activity, so get in touch if you’re looking for a collaboration or have ideas for similar projects!

4. **Scientific Data Analysis** 🧪   
Check out the repos of the data analysis pipelines from some of my published research projects: 
    - Microbiome analysis in `R`:["The bacterial microbiome of symbiotic and menthol-bleached polyps of *Galaxea fascicularis* in captivity"](https://github.com/sPuntinG/Galaxea_Microbiome_PCI)
    - Coral physiological data analysis ["The reef-building coral *Galaxea fascicularis*: a new model system for coral symbiosis research"](https://github.com/sPuntinG/Galaxea_Coral_Model/tree/main)
    - Seawater chemistry analysis: [alkalinity calculations](https://github.com/sPuntinG/TA_Gran)      

   You can also explore my **full publication list** on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.nz/citations?user=827VF-YAAAAJ&hl=en).

    

## Future Plans & Collaboration Interests 💡

I'm eager to expand my skill set and collaborate on projects that make a difference. Here are some areas I'm keen to explore/expand:

- 📦 Contribute to an `R` package 
- 🐬 `SQL` to scale up data wrangling speed and capacity
- 📊 Creating visually engaging websites to showcase impactful data storytelling: `Hugo` (`Go`), `D3`, `CSS`, `HTML`, `Java`
- 🤖 Machine learning models for predictive analytics
- 🐍 `Python` for versatile data analysis

🤙 Feel free to reach out if you have an exciting idea for a collaboration or a discussion!
